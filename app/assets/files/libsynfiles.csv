We have the official announcement of the paper deck versions of the Duels of the Planeswalkers decks. Last but not least, we have the top 4 decklists from the Midwest Master Qualifiers Chicago standard tournament.

David Noonan reviews a cool new magic variant called ""Frontier Magic"" on the mothership site. Don't miss the judges appreciation event to be held on MTGO called MOJO (Magic Online Judge Open)! Congratulations to Russell Tassicker for getting a top 8 at the Australian Nationals and his write up on Mananation.

B-movie recommendation: Tiki (2006)
What does one get when you mix an androgenous ""Boy George""-channeling female lead, unsettling nudity, lack of diversity and a small non-threatening wooden wall decoration? Apparently, you get funded by Image Entertainment to make a direct-to-video cultural abomination titled ""Tiki"".
Synopsis:When Amy moves from her beloved Hawaiian Islands to study drama on the mainland, she has little cause to rejoice as a gang of vicious co-eds plots to make her life a living hell. Wih the aid of their boyfriends, the girls set Amy up as the target of a horrendous prank that results in the young girl falling victim to a brain seizure from which she may never recover. Seeking answers, her aunt Maelea arrives with a special Tiki doll -- specially designed to kill! Through magic, she coaxes Amy's subconscious spirit to enter the idol's body and bring it to hideous life. Now the idol tracks down the students one by one to exact its grisly revenge in a relentless assault of Tiki terror!

Wow, it is a fantastic (and mostly magic filled) episode with Tom, Jack and Marcel (starring his new headset).

Congratulations to Tomoharu Saito for winning GP Columbus (Legacy). We also discuss the DQ of Drew Levin for ""betting on himself"" and also the ""pieing"" of Gerry Thompson by Patrick Chapin. G4 does a review of MTG Tactics with some nice screen shots and also some concerns. 

What Have We Been Playing?
Marcel has been having fun with Sarkhan the Mad and Mitotic Slime, Jack has been playing some pauper All in Red and Tom is oh-so proud of his new UWB EDH deck titled ""The Mathematician's Wet Dream"" and you can see the deck list here.

This Week in Magic
Oh yeah, it's Tom, Jack and Conley is back! Conley gives us the low down on the immense magic weekend at Gencon and this includes a Vintage Championship, Legacy Championship, Zendikar Block Championship, Sealed 2HG Championship and more. We also revisit the GP Columbus wagering discussion with Conley and turns out to be very enlightening with more of the background on the pro tour player side and perspective. Mirrodin Beseiged was announced officially (who doesn't love the three letter code of MBS). FNM promo for September is Qasali Pridemage. 

What Have We Been Playing?
Conley gives the low down on his various decks of GenCon. Tom asks for some help on a budget friendly Standard deck to try and win his full art Mitotic Slime AND has some new cards to think of for his Mathematician's Wet Dream EDH deck in Trinisphere, Magus of the Tabernacle, Pendrell Mists, Peacekeeper.

Listener Emails

This Week in Magic
Wow, Tom + Jack + Marcel equals a huge week of magic news and some buttery smooth manly voices.

We have a few new Scars of Mirrodin previews from the Duel Decks: Elspeth vs Tezzeret (which for unknown reasons, Jack doesn't like) with Contagion Clasp and Kemba's Skyguard. The Clasp also shows a new keyword, Proliferate, that seems to be quite awesome. We have some details about 2010 State and Provincial championships on October 9th. For unknown reasons, PC World attacks magic players by choosing the Magic World Championships in it's top dorkiest tournaments and then shows a friggin' Yu-gi-oh card (was changed at the time of this recording). The second Duels of the Planeswalker expansion pack is coming and will be available on Steam on September 1. We also delve into thenewly announced ""Event Decks"" that will help you compete at your local FNM and will be available as of February 25th, 2010. A new ""play or draw"" rule will debut for the Top 8 at PT Amsterdam. GP Gothenburg was this past weekend, champion was Kenny Oberg and Conley Woods placed 9th! SCG Open was in Minneapolis the past weekend with Ken Adams winning the Legacy portion and Ian Ellis bringing home the Standard portion. The Great Designer Search 2 was officially announced to start on September 29th and also had a very cool fake logo for Homelands 2. Last, we have the link to the collection of Scars of Mirrodin art. 

What Have We Been Playing?
Tom is busy revamping his BG Ooze tribal deck to use those full art Mitotic Slime's and will be abusing Death Cloud happily. Jack asks for some help with a Dragonstorm deck and Marcel is playing Terran with a splash of Protoss.

Listener Emails
Jack says a big thank you to all of the listeners that emailed him with encouragement. Marcel answers some emails after his fantastic solo show. Link to the epic Justin Beiber slowed 800%. Link to the cheesiest movies of all time. And yes, that's the trailer for Ghost Shark 2: Urban Jaws.

This Week in Magic
Eric joins Tom for a Old Spice fueled old-man cast. It is all about the Scars of Mirrodin previews flowing from PAX like a busted boil. Here is the unofficial spoiler along with WoTC mechanic review and we discuss the awesome small infect creatures (will this affect EDH?), Metalcraft and it's appearance on the long-awaited Mox Opal, the return of Imprint (which feels un-Imprint on Clone Shell) and the amazing new planeswalkers seen so far. PT Amsterdam was this past weekend and congratulations to Paul Rietzl bringing it home in a star-studded (or just studded if you are Eric) Top 8 and Conley goes undefeated day one and brings home 22nd place in the end - interesting extended decks in the top 8 with mono-white weenie and a new take on Doran. The Hall of Fame 2010 ballot results were released with three players making the 40.00% cut with Nassif, Kibler and Saito and some expected controversy (Tom feels there should be the addition of rounding up). Promo watch continues with the new judge new art promos of Wheel of Fortune and Wasteland along with the October FNM promo Rift Bolt.

What Have We Been Playing?
Tom is excited to meet some listeners in Jamestown, ND and also wonders if any players in Miles City, MT up for games on Tuesday or Wednesday of this week (Sept 8-9).

We also discuss the big changes over on Star City Games regarding premium articles, free articles and the overall vision for their article content. The math was re-visited on the Hall of Fame ballots and Bram Snepvangers is now in the Hall of Fame, yeah! Fantastic article by Dave Meeson about Tribal Myr's this week and I love the interaction of Myr Galvanizer and Shared Discovery.Martin Juza brings home GP Portland in a field of nearly 1400 players and kudos to Ryan from Limited Resources for getting 44th place!

What Have We Been Playing?
Marcel is back to MTG and having fun with classic white weenie using Shadow and the various Swords (i.e. Sword of Fire and Ice) for nefarious means. Jack is continuing some EDH love. Tom gives a big shout out to David and the crew from Jamestown, ND for all the awesome cards, the ""Urine Trouble"" DVD and some good games. TheBeme shares the interesting multi-player variant his local play group uses.

It has to happen at some point, and that is Tom messing up and losing roughly 2/3 of one his favorite podcasts ever. A big thank you to Big Head Joe from Yo! MTG Taps and Adam Styborski along with Robert from the Mana Screwed podcast for a great one. I was able to recover the first ~45 minutes of the show. Enjoy and I am off to stick my hand in a meat grinder.

This Week in Magic
Wow, it is a star-studded cast with Conley, Gavin, Tom, Jack, Robert and Adam Styborski (his Pauper cube site and his Twitter feed). 

We start of with Ruel's article about bluffing and is it a real concern or not so much in Magic. Then, we jump feet first into the big WPN controversy with tournament support being restricted to stores only and is in effect NOW. SCG.com Open Series in Nashville was this past weekend with Jessie Butler winning the Legacy portion and Jacob Baugh wins the Standard portion. We get a view of the upcoming Gateway and Gameday prizes. The new GP promo is Maelstrom Pulse. 

What Have We Been Playing?
Adam has his new Karn EDH deck on his latest Serious Fun article. Robert is working on some Mono blue, Tom is excited to update his Experiment Kraj EDH deck with Proliferate! Gavin is chomping for Extended and Conley talks some SoM Sealed.

Listener Emails
It is a shorter list after our abrupt show end last week and I apologize for not mentioning Joep's great new MTG combo site, http://combo.magicology.nl/index.php.

We have the MTGO event calendar for November and December along with the announcement of Momir Basic ""pre-con"" decks for use in the new Momir basic daily events. New TCGPlayer Wizard World Series event announced for New Orleans Comic Con on January 28-30, 2011. The new Lilianna Vess DoTP promo for the PS3 launch looks pretty nice (from the SCG Facebook profile). And now to the meat, the full spoiler list for Masters Edition IV is readily viewable on Gatherer (full list) and there is some crazy stuff here, also leads to the discussion that Library of Alexandria is in the set and not on the update Classic B&R list. Tom, and likely Chris, are pumped to be invited to a media event from Sony Online Entertainment to check out more about the upcoming MTG: Tactics game for PC / PS3. 

What Have We Been Playing?
Tom is lovin' some mono-white life gain in Standard. Chris has hit some rough times in M11 / SoM draft online. Jack is doing some cheap gobbos in Standard and looking at Savra, Queen of the Golgari. Adam has been doing his darndest to play some Commander online with some issues.

MTGCast News
Tom would love some contest ideas, ideas for questions / videos for the trip to Sony to see MTG: Tactics, and ideas for cards that would be great for a ""Create some flavor text for this card"" contest.

Special guest host, Adam Styborski - author of the ""Serious Fun"" article series on DailyMTG.com (latest article). 

This Week in Magic
Tom, Chris, Adam, Conley, Jack AND Marcel bring you a rather roller coaster of a week as Conley is clearly off his meds. The Mirrodin Beseiged talk starts off with the newly seen release and pre-release promos as well as the new keyword, Battle cry. Then we are off to talk about the upcoming Game Day Mirrodin Besieged War League and why you may or may not care. Conley gives some good feedback on why it is great to hear that Merfolk Looter effects will be creeping into red at the common level. A thief is busted stealing well over $45,000 in cards from WoTC while an employee. We also discuss the very new and innovative, but not without it's faults, Mana Screwed 2010 MTG Awards. 

What Have We Been Playing?
Tom gleefully abused Nether Void in his latest EDH games while playing Mathematician's Wet Dream. Conley played some TSE drafts, Marcel rocked some mono black infect Proliferate, Jack played some ""fair unpowered Vintage"" or whatever that means. Adam is enjoying some Scars Limited with a completely busted card pool.

Listener Emails

This Week in Magic
Wow, it is an amazing group with Tom, Robert, Jack, Tristan from Channel Fireball and Adam Styborski from DailyMTG. We start with Conley's stand-off with some hot sauce. WoTC has a new official area on Playstation Home to check out. Tom completely misunderstands what a reciprocity fee is and how it will affect players going to GP Santiago. Check out the crazy nerdcore Mirrodin Beseiged rap on Mananation. FTV: Legends has been officially announced. WoTC is looking for some employees (especially if you love DUEL MASTERS!). And all of the crew is looking forward to the Magic Weekend in Paris. We also share the love of Wolf Pack from Portal 3 Kingdoms. 

Listener Emails
A bunch of good ""don't google this"" suggestions and don't look at the card for Basal Thrull.

This Week in Magic
Tom, Robert and Chris bring you a pre-Valentine's Day megacast, and good wishes to Adam Styborski who is recovering from a cold.

The news is dominated by the Pro Tour and Grand Prix this weekend in Paris for the ""Magic Weekend"". The GP was in the top 8 at the time of recording and kudos to Kai Budde with making it!Congratulations to Ben Stark for winning Pro Tour Paris playing Caw-Go in a top 8 dominated by the mirror match and Boros decks (top 8 decklists). And Brad Nelson emerges victorious to become the 2010 Player of the Year. We also discuss the overall coverage of the Magic Weekend and the somewhat odd non-coverage of the PT quarter finals due to ""logistics and limitations of space"". The Magic Weekend judges were greeted by two new promos of Bitterblossom and Vendillion Clique. Link to the video of 4,000 creature damage in one turn of DoTP. Super collectors cringe as confirmation that Scars Tokens in Mirrodin Besieged boosters, with Besieged themed backs on them. Winter WPN Kit has been spotted featuring promo Signal Pest, Master's Call, Plague Myr, 2 new Archenemy Schemes. World Chess Federation is sponsoring another contest with $10,000 to improve the Elo player ranking system, which happens to be the same system that MTG uses. MNM gets an ego massage by Luke's new article on Mana Nation reviewing some of his favorite MTG podcasts. Link to the Mirrodin mini-site, Urabrask wallpaper, Geosurge wallpaper,Chancellor of Annex wallpaper. Magic-League article on the new Legacy metagame. The GDS2 finalists have been chosen! Pics of the planeswalker tattoo art, picture A and picture B.

Make sure to check out Robert manning the SCGLive coverage of GP Denver this weekend. 

Check out the March 5th, 2011 Winter Series $5K Championship from Channel Fireball.

What Have We Been Playing?
We discuss some of the recent Standard developments high-lighted by PT Paris.

This Week in Magic
Tom, Chris, Robert (with cameos by Jack and Marcel) bring you a sunday version of the show. We will cover the New Phyrexia potential spoilers on the next podcast once it looks like everything is legit. We toot our own horn on a press release that MTGCast.com has surpassed 4 million downloads. Promotional material for Duels of the Planeswalker 2012 with different Titans as platform-dependent promos help suggest they will be in M12. Check out Luke Sonnier's Cast Through Time #8 for summaries of many popular MTG podcasts. SOE layoffs potentially threaten MTG:Tactics.Cool interview with a two new magic artists: Jana Schirmer & Johannes Voss. And we have the official announcement for New Phyrexia and we talk about the new sweet Pitch Black-esque EDH general. We are sad to share that Erik Friborg of PureMTGO passed away suddenly. Edgar Flores wins SCG.com Open Series ATL standard with U/W Cawblade. We discuss a new magic player business, MTG Pad, where you can order customized game state / score sheets. Magic (?vendors) are under investigation in Spain for price fixing.

What Have We Been Playing?
Robert will be at GP: Dallas doing video and audio coverage for Channel Fireball and MTGCast. Chris gets a Top 8 at the Grand Prix Trial for Providence. Tom is getting in to some MTGO pauper and 30 card limited. 

Listener Emails

This Week in Magic
Join Tom, CONLEY, Jack, Chris, Robert and Adena for a run down NPH lane. WoTC has a big announcement about doubling the number of GP's, no more large regional pre-releases and private PT's. We all run through some our thoughts and picks for the current crop of NPH cards and Conley gives his underdog pick (hint, it's Phyrexian Unlife) from the unofficial spoiler. Sheoldred, the Whispering One will be our pre-release promo. A Planeswalkers guide to new Phyrexia goes over Black and shows the art for what appears to be a new Skirge and mentions ""Wrack Imps"". The NPH Event decks appear to be mono-green and mono-white. On the mothership,Tom LaPille addresses the fact that JTMS was the most played card (including basic lands) in the latest GP Top 8. ""New Judge Announcements from DCIJudges on Twitter. Congrats to new L5 Scott Marshall, new L4 Damián Hiller, new L4 Cristiana Dionisio, and new L3 Kevin Binswanger!!"". Online Poker gets a legal pimp slap. Congrats to Gavin and KYT for qualifying for US Nationals playing Caw-Blade. The May FNM promo is the timely Squadron Hawk. 

B-movie pick: ""Best of the Best"" with Eric Roberts, Chris Penn, James Earl Jones (1989)

Conley and Tom also delve a bit into their favorite fast food and the impressive re-invention of Long John Silvers from the trash heap in the 1980's to a respectable place today.

Listener Emails
Link to the 2009 cultural ""remake"" with Black Dynamite. Nik Z with an excellent meta-game viewed discussion of a MTGO pauper deck.

This Week in Magic
A huge thank you and welcome to our new monthly sponsor, Half Price Hobbies!

Tom, Conley, Jack, Adena and a quick appearance by Eric bring your this podcast focused entirely on New Phyrexia (NPH, yeah!), odd rants and Conley's vehement hatred for Torpor Orb.

We talk about the controversy of the ""Godbook"" leak and the classy response by WoTC to release an official spoiler of the set on DailyMTG. We then run through our picks. So, make sure to not miss Conley's can't miss picks for Standard / Legacy / Extended, Tom looking at Tribal and Pauper, Jack and Adena looking at the rest of the good stuff. And keep your eye out for some Splinter Twin shenanigans, you've been warned. 

We also come up with some card names that would also work for WoTC's new energy drink.

What Have We Been Playing?
Tom forces Conley to quickly review NPH for cards for his standard RG Furnace Celebration deck.

Listener Emails
Not much this past week, but I am pretty sure we will have plenty next week!

MTGCast News
Keep an eye out as MTGCast hopefully has an uneventful transition to it's new dedicated host. Please lord, let it go smoothly.

The Sony Online woes are affecting other games, such as MTG Tactics. Rhox War Monk is our June FNM promo. And already, we enter unconfirmed rumor territory with some possible M12 cards and a good discussion of set-specific abilities finding their way into the base set. 

What Have We Been Playing?
Conley, Adena, and *gasp* TOM go over their pre-release experiences. Tom hearts Blinding Souleater.

We also have some policy updates for 2011 Nationals Invitations, video interview with Mark Rosewater about Mike Long, challenge tochange the ELO ratings system, link to the $94,000 Wayne Gretzky rookie card.

Listener Emails

This Week in Magic
Tom, Jack, Adena, Eric, Robert and special guest David bring you a ""Modern"" take on podcasting and salivate over some NPH event decks.

We have the deck lists for the two NPH event decks and one is very tasty with TWO Stoneforge Mystic, while the other is a somewhat bland mono-green Infect deck. We have the deck list and name of the first opponent planeswalker for Duels of the Planeswalker 2012 and rumors abound she may up in Innistrad. WoTC hits with a minor and major bomb this week. Minor bomb is the Extended and Block now are official FNM formats. Major bomb is the announcement of a new format, ""Modern"", to debut in the Community Cup. M12 buy-a-box promo is Chandra's Phoenix. We discuss the apparently much-maligned ""Quest for Karn"" novel and you can read a sample chapter. Discussion abounds regarding the Standard finals at SCG:KY Open series and winner Alex Gonzalez. 

What Have We Been Playing?
Jack discusses Hawkward in Standard as Tom ponders what to play in his next Standard tourney.

Listener Emails
Lots of good ones. Link the ""A Milli"" video that Tom has never, ever heard of before.

This Week in Magic
It's late, but it is also just that much better with a bit of age. Tom, Tristan, Adena and Robert bring you a special Wednesday morning ""coyote ugly"" edition of MTGCast full of M12, DoTP 2012, Commander, and more!

We run through the new M12 mechanics (and don't miss a very bloodthirsty dragon), sneak previews from Tristan at the DoTP 2012 preview (official WoTC DoTP page) and more. Congrats to all of the MTGCast'ers in the 2011 Community Cup featuring Ryan on the WoTC side (congrats on the new job!) and Marshall on the community side. Adena notes the very cool observation that per the rules of the Modern format (anything with new card frame) that Commander cards (current spoiler list) are fair game! 

Listener Emails
A slew of great emails. Link to the YouTube Epic Rap Battles of History. And the official movie page of ""Hobo with a Shotgun"" featuring one of my favorite actors, Rutger Hauer. Link to more info about Surge, the ultimate beverage.

This Week in Magic
Join Tom, Jack and Adena as they run through a magic weekend, Commander previews, some GP / PT info and more! And some ice skating references and lots of uses for foldable furniture.

We jump right into the Commander Preview weekend and run through the current spoilers (on MTGSalvation), including our first view of Join Forces, and Tom gets his baby with The Mimeoplasm. Congratulations to Paulo Vitor Damo da Rosa for winning GP Singapore with CawBlade. PT Nagoya is coming up next week, so put your hands together and clap loudly for Conley Woods. Gavin is all over the magic world giving us some new info on the SCG Open series events and big news for season 2 of the SCGLive coverage. He also is spear-heading the Over Extended format and it even has it's own website now, mtgoverextended.com. Rumors swirl as the icon legend for DoTP 2012 shows icons for both Shadow and Fading. 

Tom then bores us all to tears telling everyone what an awesome time he had at the first MTGCast Listener Event in Seattle. A big thank you to Card Exchange for hosting our motley crew, BJ Shea and everyone from the Morning Experience on KISW 99.9FM, Andrew from WoTC for hand-delivering a Snow Mercy to Tom, Jamie / Alex / Jesse for a slew of memorable casual games, Dan at for showing us a crazy night at Cafe Mox. And to David, for putting this whole thing together!

Happy Birthday to Chris on June 9th turning the big 38!

Listener Emails

Big news is that we have the entire Commander spoiler to run down, and we also say ""WE SORRY"" about our complete FUBAR'ing of Join Forces last week.

Congratulations to David Sharfman for winning PT Nagoya (Block constructed then Draft) with Puresteel Paladin being the true stand-out. 

What Have We Been Playing?
Chris talks about his SCG Open Series: Denver experience and playing some Caw Blade in Standard and very awesome Mono-U in Legacy.

We talk about the potential bill that would make streaming MTGO matches a felony offense and how you can blame Minnesota for this one. Make sure to read about Adam Styborski's MTGO Community Cube and that yes, you can play cube on MTGO! Conley runs us through the updates on the TCGPlayer World Championship tournament and also the cool new beta cart optimizer that potentially help save some money. Check out the packaging for the upcoming Ajani vs. Nicol Bolas Duel Decks. Then, we break full steam into M12 talk (full unofficial spoiler) with limited, constructed, legacy formats, casual, EDH, Tribal discussion and more! Fun to hear how cards like Last Chance and Warrior's Oath have shot up in value.

This Week in Magic
Tom and Jack bring you a sunlight-fueled MNM this week and have a surprising amount to talk about.

We had our M12 pre-releases this weekend with official spoilers and news directly from Aaron Forsythe about the frustrations of players in larger cities being turned away due to lack of space at local card stores with no more large pre-releases. Tom asks for your help on some ideas for the ""trick"" in a Spider tribal deck and asks you what you see in this card art:


Dungrove Elder and Stormblood Berserker are the Game Day promos. Progenitus and Kresh, the Bloodbraided confirmed to be in FTV:Legends. We discuss some of the ideas floating around for Tiago Chan's 2007 Invitational card that will appear in Innistrad - along with the list of prior Invitational cards. Link to info on GP Milan and GP Amsterdam. And a thank you to Eric Linden and Luke Sonnier on Gatheringmagic.com for their weekly columns.

Tom and Jack also have a key discussion on product placement in Magic and feel that it is only a matter of time until we see a Elemental Baja Blast coming to you from Taco Bell.


What Have We Been Playing?
Jack talks about some of his decks for upcoming columns and Tom continues to lament about making a Spider tribal deck.

This Week in Magic
Tom, Jack and Chris from the Horde of Notions podcast bring you a pretty light news week, but some excellent hygiene tips.

We have the cards that will grace the over-sized prizes for the 2011 Vintage (Time Walk) and Legacy (Force of Will) tournaments. Steve Argyle shows us the likely art for the new Liliana for Innistrad. Tom is irrationally excited for the M12 event decks with Illusionary Might (OH GOD YES!) and Vampire Onslaught. We take a peek at the interesting UBW ""Night Shift"" decks starring Gravitational Shift that took 8th and 9th at SCG Pittsburgh. We also briefly mention that Aaron Forsythe gave the official nod to the Modern format at SD:CC and makesOverextended less likely to be official for the near future. 

Listener Emails
Jack gets a classic trolling when Arthur Herbert Fonzarelli posts a response to his article on Manadeprived.com. Intro for the movie, Barbarella. Link to watch the amazing, Judge Dreadlocks.

But it is a good thing, since we can talk about the official roll out of Modern at PT Philly, the full list with art of the FTV:Legends set. Universal drops the MTG movie, the new ISD Garruk art, some kick butt Three Werewolf Moon card sleeves and more.

This Week in Magic

Wow, we have a BUTT LOAD of Innistrad news, including the verification of what everyone thought was a schizophrenic rumor about the Double-Faced Cards and the other mechanics to be seen in the set.  A run down of the new ""Phantom"" events on MTGO.   Modern Format is now on MTGO, release events 8/24 - 9/7.  A complete flame bait article on Gizmodo about some harpy women ragging on an OkCupid date with a magic player, but make that magic Jon MotherF&$*ing Finkel.  

Listener Emails
As promised, a bunch of awesome emails.  Including a listener seeing his boss pull a real life Don't Google This!  Link to the Starcrash trailer.  Link to Staying Power.  Link to Maro's article from 2006 going over Un-cards that had made it into mainstream sets.  Check out the Seraphim MTGO clan.  

MTGCast News
Not much.  Except Tom got suspended from MTGSalvation for the link to meatspin DOT com a few weeks ago.

This Week in Magic

Tom, Chris (from World at War, Horde of Notions, pretty much every podcast we have) and Trevor from the Manasculpting podcast bring an Innistrad, and wrestling, filled podcast this week.

We break right in to the most current Innistrad previews, including flavor picks, standard picks, legacy picks and Tom's biggest let-down ever in Creepy Doll.  We also run down PT Philly, talk about the first real appearance of the Modern format (Top 8 deck lists, and all Modern decks with >= 18 points), some break out decks and the pure joy of seeing a mono-blue infect deck pitching Dragonstorm to Blazing Shoal!  And don't miss the Wizards of the Cats from the weekend as well.  Check out this tasty Doubling Season judge promo from PT Philly.  IDW Publishing is launching a MTG comic book.  Jeremy Jarvis with a great article on the Innistrad art.  We are sad to hear the Peter Szigeti passed away and has some colorful history in the MTG tourney scene (Searing Blaze anyone?).

Contact info for:

Chris: @lansdellicious - lansdellicious@gmail.com

Trevor: @trevorisham - trevor.manasculpting@gmail.com - www.manasculpting.com

Listener Emails
As promised, a bunch of awesome emails.  Get your own copy of the Ecto Cooler recipe and just the plain weirdness of a Chicago branch of Ghostbusters.  Check out Isaac's blog and thoughts about the magic card back.   And thesweet, sweet altered art Dismember.  Link to the 3 Hoff moon t-shirt and of course, the book front for ""Images to Not Masturbate To"".

Tom is officially going to actually update the site using the very slick PressWork Wordpress framework and either modifying the base theme or waiting for their promised podcast-specific theme!

This Week in Magic

The internets ate another podcast, so Tom decides to say ""what the hell"" and throw a spontaneous live show!  Luckily Chris (@lansdellicious – lansdellicious@gmail.com) and Jack help keep him out of trouble, as well as some call-ins and live chat!  Fun!  Audio quality is surprisingly decent and think we will be doing this quite a bit in the future, and Tom will get a good phone headset to kick it up a notch.  Onto the news!

We run down the announcement of Planeswalker Points, Duels of the Planeswalkers 2012 DLC, Innistrad previews and some of the crazy secondary market card prices of Leveler, Thought Lash with the preview of a new alternate win-condition with Laboratory Maniac.  Also a bit about the changes to the SCG Players Club that have many upset.

Listener Emails
As promised, a bunch of awesome emails and of course our live callers and chat questions!

This Week in Magic

It's Live again!  Tom just can't get enough, and now enjoy actually tolerable audio quality.  Plan is for Live recordings on Mondays at 6pm CST on Talkshoe (listen live here)!

It's the week coming up to the Innistrad pre-releases, so we have the entire card list.  Tom shares some picks, and Tom from the classic MTGRadio show helps out with some EDH picks as well.  We also run down the updated Banned and Restricted list, with the most excitement coming from the Modern changes.  The Innistrad Gateway promos revealed with Bloodcrazed Neonate and Curse of the Bloody Tome.  Review the drafting rules changes for double-faced cards and try out some 3xISD drafts on magicdraftsim.com.   States 2011 is announced and read about it here.  GP San Diego is now Innistrad limited and sounds quite awesome.  Mark Rosewater makes Tom sad and kills off the Tribal supertype.  And WoTC registers a Cube related trademark.

B-movie pick of the week is Tucker & Dale vs Evil (2010).

Listener Emails
As promised, live callers and chat questions!  Thank you to Trymantha for a donation and the tip on donating some money to the Desert Bus for Hope event raising money for the Child's Play charity.  We also have a donation from a listener and recommendation to check pacificmountainincense.com.

First off, a big hello and welcome to our new sponsors, the Decked Builder and Drafter iPhone apps!

I almost hate to give it more publicity, but here is a link to the now infamous Darwin Kastle dating article.  November FNM promo is Go For the Throat.  First issue of the IDW MTG Comic introduces a new planeswalker - Dack Fayden, along with an exclusive alternate art playable card!  MTGO Innistrad pre-releases on October 13th (coincidence?).  Check out the trailer for the independent magic film, Tap: Max's Game.

And, of course, a link to the wikipedia page on Torpedo Juice (safe for work, I promise).

What's this?  Gavin Verhey (@GavinVerhey) was hired by WoTC as a R&D intern?  And he is on the show this week AND next week before he starts because he is just that awesome?  YES.

Mark Rosewater hints us some tidbits on Dark Ascension and ""Roll"" with likely return of Unearth, as well as seen double-faced cards being used on not just creatures.  Today's Arcana answers Tom's burning question on whether the art for ""Army of the Damned"" really has 13 zombies on it.  Innistrad pre-release numbers reportedly up by 32%.  If you loved the magic puzzles from Inquest or the Duelist, make sure to check out the ""Puzzling Magic"" articles on GatheringMagic.com site.   A listener has written a very cool iPhone app to let you play Momir Basic where ever you are, app is called MTGMomir.  

Tom's B-movie pick of the week is ""Troll 2"".

Treasure Hunt is the alternate art promo in the first issue of the IDW MTG comic.  The winter PTQ season is officially Modern to the joy of pretty much everyone.  Tom is baffled by why everyone is so up in arms with having theTop 8 PTQ pins disappearing.  Gavin gives some great feedback on Modern and the Planeswalker Point manifesto on Channel Fireball.  

Tom’s B-movie pick of the week is ""Waxwork II: Lost in Time"".

Mr. Suitcase,Mr_Suitcase_032,"For my second show from GP Nashville, I sat down for a brief chat with Luis Scott-Vargas himself (@LSV on Twitter).  He gave some of his opinions about the new Grand Prix structure, the amount of teamwork that Team ChannelFireball puts into GP preparation, and the current Sealed Deck format.  (Chewie note: He even tried to get LSV to talk smack about double-faced cards!)

After that, there’s some commentary about my sealed pool and performance in Grinder 4.  My friend Tony and I go over my pool again later to see what, if anything, could have been done differently.  If you have any specific things you would like to hear on the show while I’m here in Nashville, please reach out to me on Twitter!  You can find me as @EricMTGCast there.

And I’d like to give a special thanks to Chewie for hosting these shows on his site and getting them up (almost) live for me.  And another special thanks goes out to Mana Deprived for hosting my text write-up, which will be going up after the weekend is over!

Larva (2005, direct to TV) - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0393421/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1
In Host, Missouri, the newcomer Dr. of Veterinary Science Eli Rudkus is called by the farmer Jacob Long to exam one of his cows. The veterinarian finds a strange parasite in the animal and sends it to a friend in the Department of Agriculture for research. Later, he finds the same parasite in a creek and he summons the population for a meeting, warning that the cause might be the animal food. However, Fletcher Odermatt, the wealthy owner of the local Host Tender Meals that has been providing free animal food for the farmers, brings his lawyer Hayley Anderson and discredits Eli. When a huge mutant parasite attacks Eli and Jacob, they discover that the meals are actually an experimental genetic cocktail that is growing parasites inside the kettles and people.

Extended has changed as we know it, changes can be found here. Card prices, twitter, and everything is in an uproar over this change but an open format is now here and it keeps magic more exciting.

 

EDH Bannings:

EDH has also changed quiet a bit with Rofellos being rebanned as a general, and a few cards being banned for regular game play.

 

Top ten Douchiest and Friendiest generals:

Thanks to @Panahinuva and @Strammermax for this idea and we will at least begin the discussion today.

NYC detective Allen Gamble is more comfortable pushing pencils than busting bad guys.  A meticulous forensic accountant, his numbers are never off.  Detective Terry Hoitz is Gamble's reluctant partner.  Try as Detective Hoitz might to get back on the streets, an embarrassing encounter with Derek Jeter has left a sizable black mark on his permanent record.  Detectives Danson and Highsmith are the complete opposites of Gamble and Hoitz: unwaveringly confident, they always get their man, and they do it with style to spare.  When the time comes for Gamble and Hoitz to prove their mettle and save the day, their incompetence becomes the stuff of legend.

Retro Review! - Brother's Keeper

September 9th, 1992
Domestic Gross: $1,305,915
Directed by Joe Berlinger, Bruce Sinofsky
Starring Delber Ward, Roscoe Ward, Lyman Ward, Ralph A. Cognetti – Defense Attorney
This documentary details the murder trial of Delbert Ward. Delbert was a member of a family of four elderly brothers, working as semi-literate farmers and living together in isolation from the rest of society until William's death. A police investigation and Medical Examiner's autopsy suggested that Bill may not have died from natural causes and Delbert was arrested on charges of Second-Degree Murder. Under questioning by police, Delbert appears to have waived his rights and signed a confession, but this film suggests that he may not have been competent to do so. The film explores possible motives for the crime, from 'mercy-killing' (Bill was ill at the time) to progressively more bizarre hypotheses. It also shows how residents of the rural community of Munnsville, NY rallied to the support of one of their own residents (previously considered a social outcast), against what they felt were intrusive 'big-city' police and District Attorney tactics.

Protection from Noob,ProtNoob_004,"Rise Of The Eldrazi is around the proverbial corner and this week Lennox is joined by new co-hosts Chad and Iain to parse the incomplete spoiler and give their take on how the set is shaping up. From the mighty Emrakul, the Aeons Torn to the ineffective Glory Seeker, the trio undertake the mammoth (umbra) task of simultaneously breaking down the set so far, and making terrible puns.

What game is more fitting to provide the intro music for a 'cast looking at big creatures than Shadow Of The Colossus by Team Ico? We couldn't think of one either and that's why SotC ended up being this week's videogame theme.

Let us know in the comments what you think of the cards we talked about, as well as anything that changed in your estimations at the Prerelease.

Protection from Noob,ProtNoob_005,"Rise Of The Eldrazi has finally been released upon the world, much like Emrakul's own escape upon the plane of Zendikar, and Lennox and Chad discuss their first hands-on experience with the new cards at their pre-releases. They look at what hits and misses they made in their predictions (hint: regress is good in limited), as well as cards that weren't even on their radar. They also discuss the decks they and their opponents played and what they think of the format so far...

Zendikar is a world full of dangerous terrain under foot and floating blocks in the sky, and it looks a lot like the Mushroom Kingdom if you squint hard enough. The only thing it's missing garish green pipes. This tenuous connection is all the excuse needed to make this episode's video game theme Super Mario! Just don't try jumping on the top of an Eldrazi!

This week, the Scrubs welcome girl and L2 judge Allison Medwin to the cast.  We talk about judge/girly stuff for a while, then start breaking down the new Modern format.  If you know anything about this podcast, it's that drunken rants are the norm.  We are forced to form a militia to fight the beast known as Casby when Modern discussions start getting personal.  It's another action packed week of lovable antics, what can we say WELCOME TO SCRUBLAND!

The scrubs are learning that there is nothing more dangerous than a woman scorned.  In this spill-over episode, Allison Medwin teaches the boys a thing or two about what it means to be a woman in the MTG community.  DSale obviously already knows everything and attempts to take back the block, but we all know who's wearing the pants on this podcast.  Play nice children, WELCOME TO SCRUBLAND!

Sector 512 Podcast,Sector 512 Podcast #50 - Top 10 Animals,"Blobfish, Korean Penis Fish, Candiru, oh my!

Those mysterious Sector 512 guys are back are dredging up all of god's best depravities for your listening pleasure.  As anticipated, multiple lists are dedicated to the animals of the world with the biggest penises and it basically rolls down hill like a 12 inch log from there.

Don't miss some absolutely repulsive items like duck rape, ""traumatic insemination"", corkscrew vaginas, bottle brush cocks, gelatinous flesh, copious slime production, willy-nilly sex changes, and the ""Bo Jackson"" of the animal kingdom.  My god, our mothers would be ashamed and onto the pictures!


Yes son, that is its corkscrew ridculously huge rape-happy duck penis

Korean Penis Fish or ""Huge Uncircumcised Throbbing Dick Fish""

The thing on the right is the semi-autonomous octopus pussy seeker penis

Envision that all angry and jammed head first up your pee-hole

Hagfish - Looks like Jaws mated with a Graboid sporting collagen lip injections

Blobfish - About the only thing a duck won't rape

Scotoplane - Just imagine this thing giving you an eskimo kiss

Wildcard is to come up with a new animal mascot for the Minnesota Twins to replace that lame-ass plushy-wannabe TC the Bear.  Apparently nothing says Minnesota like invasive species.

Send in a list for the next episode to tom@sector512productions.com and it will be the Top 10 Children's Books That Need to Be Written (examples include ""Everybody Poops on Tammie's Two Mommies"" or ""Show Me on the Doll where the Wild Things Touched You"") and the wild card is to pick your favorite existing children's book.

Help Me Raise Money for Alex's Lemonade Stand Foundation:
I am training to run my first full marathon in November (the Philadelphia Marathon) and I have joined Team Lemon which helps to raise money to find cures for pediatric cancers. Please visit my official Alex's Lemonade Stand page and make a donation to help support cancer research and support families with children who have cancer. I have been inspired by ALSF founder, Alexandra Scott, who lost her battle with cancer in 2004 at the age of 8. Before she passed on, she had raised more than $1 million toward finding a cure for cancer. Now seven years later, ALSF has raised more than $40 million that have funded 200 plus cutting-edge research projects. Please help!

Note: I didn't build the Eldrazi deck this week, because I do not currently see it as a viable deck in the current archetype (though I did test it out and am brewing a replacement deck which I'll reveal the finalized version of next week). Also, expect a web comic exclusive to the show that will be released once to twice a week, every week, starting next week.

Let us know your opinion of the show, but especially the web comic: how we could change the border/should we add a background? What type of music should we use? Should it be longer? It'll of course become a regular part of the show each week if you guys give us good enough feedback.

This week, Chris from MTGOAcademy.com joins to help guide Tom in how best to get started in MTGO after a many year hiatus.  Tom is looking to do some drafting, random standard / commander / tribal.  How do you build a collection?  What cool events are only on MTGO?  How do I avoid the players that just swear at me in the chat window?  All good questions!

Thanks for joining us.
