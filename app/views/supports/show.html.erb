    <h3>What Happened to MTGCast?</h3>
    <p>
      At the end of 2018, MTGCast suffered an unexpected server failure. We recovered 10,000 podcast files (give or take) but, unfortunately, we lost all of the user and post information from the WordPress database. That means that, though we didnâ€™t lose any files, those files were all essentially orphans.
    </p>
    <p>
      In February 2019, we were able to restore a skeleton version of MTGCast that allowed existing podcasters to create new accounts and claim their existing podcasts. Since then, we've been busy improving our infrastructure  and building new features.
